Panama President Mulino Responds to Fears that Trump is Reconsidering Taking Back the Canal
President José Raúl Mulino responded with a resounding “No!” to questions about fears that Trump would bring up the Canal issue. “Panama is not for sale or up for discussion.”
President José Raúl Mulino addressed the rumors about possible plans by Donald Trump related to the Panama Canal.  “Panama is not for sale or up for discussion, that much is clear,” Mulino said to business leaders and heads of state in Davos, Switzerland.  The fears had arisen after comments from the former US president about the strategic importance of the canal, but Mulino was direct: the country’s sovereignty is protected. 



During his speech, the president also emphasized that Panama will continue to be a key regional bridge, and that foreign investment is received under clear rules, without compromising the independence of the canal.  The message was a wake-up call for the markets and for those who speculated that Trump might “review” strategic projects in Central America.
